# The example is 5.1 of Z:\Github\Takilmaca\FEA\Tutorials\CompleteMaxwell3D_V11


There is a core with current excitation coil. The core is connected a bar with air  gap. The bar is also the same magnetic material with the core.

Solution type is magnetostatic. The example shows the how to obtain B field, forces and also parametric sweep.

parametric sweep can be applied to air gap distance or current excitation value and also we can animate B field changes.
